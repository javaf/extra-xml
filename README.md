# java-xml-lib

**XML** is one of the most common data exchange formats used between computers.
It is based on the idea that every data can be sub-divided into several *components*,
and that each such data can have a set of associated information or *attributes*.
Let's go through this example to better understand what XML is.

> Consider a computer. Let's say your computer was made by HP (manufacturer) who
> has provided you with warrenty card. The warrenty card  is attached to the
> *product id* of your computer and also contains information like purchase date,
> purchaser name, and some other details. All of these details can be considered
> as the *attributes* of your computer, that describe it. Again this computer is
> made up of is made up of a few parts, namely, CPU, monitor, speaker, keyboard
> and mouse. These are the *components* of your computer. Note that each of these
> components have their own product ids' and specifications, i.e., their own
> *attributes*. This is what XML is.
